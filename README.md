# ☕ Coffee Store Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📍 Project Overview

This project is part of my learning journey through the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**.  
The dataset represents one year of sales from a coffee shop, and the goal is to extract actionable insights to help improve decision-making.

The entire project follows the **6-Step Data Analysis Process**:  
**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

---

## 📊 Step 1: Ask

Clearly define the business questions:
1. Which coffee type generates the highest revenue?  
2. During which time of day are sales the highest?  
3. Do customers pay more often with cash or card?  
4. Which day of the week has the highest total sales?  
5. Which month of the year has the highest revenue?

## 🗂️ Step 2: Prepare

- Explored the structure of the dataset (columns, data types, time range)
- Confirmed that the data represents a full year of transactions
- Created a staging copy of the original dataset for safe cleaning

---

## 🧹 Step 3: Process

- Checked for duplicate rows → none found  
- Standardized the `date` format for consistency  
- Verified that all critical columns had no missing values  
- Confirmed valid values for time and payment types

---

## 📈 Step 4: Analyze

- Grouped and summarized the data to answer the business questions
- Used aggregation to calculate revenue by product, time, day, and month
- Identified key trends and behavioral patterns in customer activity

## 📤 Step 5: Share

- This README summarizes the project and key findings


---

## 🧠 Step 6: Act – Key Business Insights

Based on the analysis:

- **Latte** is the top-selling coffee → keep it highly stocked
- **10:00 AM** is the peak sales hour → ensure full staff & machine readiness by 9:30 AM
- **Card** is the most common payment method → implement or enhance digital payment methods like QR code/NFC
- **Tuesday** has the highest sales → launch loyalty programs or promotions on this day
- **March** is the top-performing month → take advantage of seasonal traffic with special offers or marketing campaigns
